## Overview

> **TL;DR:** Allocate separate budgets for instructions, history, retrieved context, tools, and examples.

Context windows are budgets. Allocate them intentionally instead of stuffing everything into the prompt.

## Why It's in the Arsenal

This tip captures a repeatable AI engineering practice that reduces failures, cost, latency, or debugging time. It is intentionally short and implementation-oriented.

## Key Features

- **Impact:** Medium
- **Time to implement:** 30 minutes
- **Applies to:** llm, memory, retrieval

## Architecture / How It Works

The practice changes one controllable part of the system—prompting, retrieval, evaluation, memory, serving, or logging—so teams can measure whether behavior improves.

## Getting Started

```python
budget = {"instructions": 800, "history": 1200, "retrieval": 5000, "output": 1000}
```

## Use Cases

1. **Scenario**: When this failure mode appears in a prototype or production trace
2. **Scenario**: When you need a low-risk improvement before changing major architecture

## Strengths

- Small enough to test quickly
- Easy to roll back if metrics do not improve
- Works best when paired with traces and evals

## Limitations / When NOT to Use

- Do not apply blindly without checking quality, cost, and latency impact
- Re-evaluate after changing model, prompt, retriever, or deployment target

## Integration Patterns

- Add a trace or eval before and after applying the tip.
- Record the change in prompt/config/version history.
- Promote failures into an evaluation dataset when possible.

## Resources

- [AI Arsenal evaluation pipelines](../observability/evaluation-pipelines.md)
- [AI Arsenal observability overview](../observability/overview.md)

## Buzz & Reception

This is a practical field tip distilled from common LLM application failure modes and should be refined with project-specific evidence.
